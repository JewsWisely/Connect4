# Project
Connect 4 w/ GUI

# Motivation
I wrote this project in 11th grade CS class after learning about stacks and queues.
I used to like creating a new project every time I learned something new and interesting
in class, and I've always had a fascination with and love for the simple game of 
Connect 4.

# Features
This rendition of Connect 4.
