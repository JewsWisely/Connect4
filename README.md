# Project
Connect 4 w/ GUI

# Motivation
I wrote this project in 11th grade CS class after learning about stacks and queues.
I used to like creating a new project every time I learned something new and interesting
in class, and I've always had a fascination with and love for the simple game of 
Connect 4.

# Features
This rendition of Connect 4 creates a 2-player game with a custom-made GUI. It
includes back and forward buttons in the case that one player makes a mistake in
their play and both players agree to take the move back. They can also be used to
analyze a position by playing it out and reverting back to the original position.
The game was also meant to support an AI to play against, but this project never
successgully implemented that (the AI would always play in the leftmost column).
